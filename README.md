# Talon Voice Dragon Engine Switcher
Provides functionality for switching to and from using Dragon as one's talon voice speech engine.

## Commands
toggle force dragon: toggles whether talon should be forced to use dragon as its speech engine.

## Settings
fire_chicken_dragon_microphone_toggle_keypress: The key sequence to press to toggle dragon's microphone. You might need to change this for the code to be able to successfully turn dragon's microphone on and off.

## Tags
user.fire_chicken_force_dragon: When this tag is active, talon is forced to use dragon as its speech engine.

## Known Issues
If talon is forced to use dragon's engine, it will not be able to switch back to conformer through voice commands if dragon freezes or crashes.

## Stuff not documented yet
The stuff in the correction folder was for working with dragon's correction system. I have not used it in a while but plan on looking at it again and documenting it later.
